The train and test function are basic loops found on the PyTorch website's tutorial page and are included as built in functions in the DynamicNetwrok modules simply for quality of life. The DynamicNetwork class countains multiple methods which all apply a specified mutation.  For exemple, the add_linear_layer method adds a new linear layer to the neural network, at a random location and with a random number of neurones. The evolve method simply apply a random mutation."
